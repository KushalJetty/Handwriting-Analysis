Chapter-12 Instruction Level Parallelism

12.1 Computer Architecture

(a) Computer Architecture is defined as the arrangement by which the various system building
blocks—processors, functional units, main memory, cache, data paths, and so on—are interconnected
and inter-operated to achieve desired system performance.

(b) Processors make up the most important part of a computer system. Therefore, in addition to (a),
processor design also constitutes a central and very important element of computer architecture.
Various functional elements of a processor must be designed, interconnected and inter-operated to

achieve desired processor performance.

« System performance is the key benchmark in the study of computer architecture. A computer
system must solve the real world problem, or support the real world application. for which the user
is installing it.

© A basic rule of system design is that there should be no performance bottlenecks in the system.

« Typically, a performance bottleneck arises when one part of the system.

« Ina computer system, the key subsystems are processors, memories, /O interfaces, and the data
paths connecting them. Within the processors, we have subsystems such as functional units.
registers, cache memories. and internal data buses.

« Within the computer system as a whole-—or within a single processor—designers do not wish to

create bottlenecks to system performance.

Example 12.1 Performance bottleneck in a system
In Fig. 12.1 we see the schematic diagram of a simple computer system consisting of four processors, a

large shared main memory, and a processor-memory bus.
