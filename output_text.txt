12.1 Computer Architecture

(a) Computer Architecture is defined as the arrangement by which the various system building

blocks—processors, functional units, main memory, cache, data paths, and 20 on—are interconnected

and imer-operated to achieve desired system performance.

(b) Processors make up the most important part of a computer system. Therefore, in addition to (a),

processer design also constitwies a central and very important element of computer architecture.

Various functional elements of a processor must be designed, intercommected and inter-operated to

© System performance is the key benchmark in the study of computer architecture. A computer
system must solve the real workd problem, or support the real world application, for which the user
is installing ia.

© A basic rule of system design is thet there should be no performance bottlenecks in the system.

© Typically, a performance bottleneck arises when one pert of the system.

© In a computer system, the key subsystems are processors, memories, 1/O interfaces, and the data
paths connecting them. Within the processors, we have subsystems such as functional units,
registers, cache memories, and internal data buses.

© Within the computer system as a whole—or within a single processor—designers do not wish to
create bottlenecks to system performance.

Example 12.1 Performance bottleneck in a system.

(n Fig. 12.1 we see the schematic diagram of a simple computer system consisting of four processors, a

large shared main memory, and a processor-memory bus.
